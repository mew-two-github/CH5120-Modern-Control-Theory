## CH5120 Assignments
My solutions for the assignments in the course Modern Control Theory, Fall 2020.
Contents  of the assignments:
1. Linear Algebra review
2. Step and impulse response models
3. Model conversion, model linearisation, MIMO as a combination of SISO models
4. Simulation of step and impulse response models, Nonlinear vs linearised simulations, implementing MIMO simulations
5. Setting up DMC
6. DMC implementation (with measured disturbance and model plant mismatch)
7. Stability, Controllability, Observability, Subspaces
8. Pole placement controller, LQR (and effects of different Q&R)
9. Kalman filter: comparison with deadbeat observer, effects of varying R1 and R2
10. State estimation in a distillation column with Kalman Filter combined with LQR controller (result: Linear Quadratic Gaussian)
11. Statespace MPC (using MPC toolbox): measured disturbance and model plant mismatch
